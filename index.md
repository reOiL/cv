## Chapter 2016: The story has begun...

> My story of becoming a programmer began with my love for the online game Dragonica.
> 
> I played this game with my friends when I was in elementary school.
> 
> By the will of fate, I had to leave the game, but I remembered about it in 2014 and I wanted to play it again.
> 
> But alas, the official servers were closed and there was one pirate server.
> 
> That day I wanted to try to make my own server.
> 
> A little later, fate brought me together with a man who helped me figure out how to set up and run the server.
>
> But we still had a lot of problems that we were able to solve together.
>
---
>
> In the same year I started trying to learn the great and terrible C++.
>
> Because I knew that dragonica was written on it and I was interested in figuring out how it works inside.

## Chapter 2017: Love and hate for C++

> I was supposed to go to college in 2017.
>
> I understood that college wouldn't give me the advanced knowledge I wanted in the next couple of years.
> 
> That's why I decided to enroll in the miracle "Moscow School of Programmers"
>
> I remember how I failed the entrance math test. The hosts must have been shocked.
>
> However, due to the fact that I tried to teach C++ on my own, I will be able to enroll immediately in the 2nd year in the Yandex department.
